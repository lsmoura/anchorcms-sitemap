Anchor CMS SiteMap
==================

A very simple sitemap implementation for AnchorCMS 0.9.2

Just add the code (site.php file) to anchor/routes/site.php, somewhere before the "View Pages" comment, and you're good to go.

Check back on this repository for any updates. I'll create a plugin as soon as the plugin api is available.

This was tested and is working on **AnchorCMS 0.9.2**.
